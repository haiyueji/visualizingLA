'  THE NEW CONCEPT OF SPACE MODERN .ABCHITECTURE SERIES II  2¥ x 2¥ Color Slides  468 Color Slides in Cardboard Younts  Single Color Slides in Cardboard lfounts  In lots or 2~ or more  Photographed by Dr. Fred Blook  ¥ 361.00  ea. 1.00  ea. .90  2"" x 2"" blaok and ~bite tloorplana -- No. 486 to 600 ea. .50  Some years after the first aeries of oolor slides on oontempol'&ry arohiteoture were isaued by  Dr. Block, but in the same year in whioh thia aet appears, he also made available a ntlW' soriea  titled Bomemaldng .!2!. Moderns. Conoerned with the funotional areas of the house or today and  the objects designed for it, this domestio note sounded a truth or architecture in our time.  SuperfioiaJ:!y~oonsidered, ouráimmediate era ~eems determined to make a popular translation, in  the shapes or handicrafts and machine made produots, or previous viotories in design, bottling  o!d wine, so to speak, in handier packages. Aotually, industrial design, at its beat moments,  represents a mellDW' interlude between war¥, conflicts in the creation ot formwhi~h constitute  the essential nature of architeoture.  Both in Europe and Alllerica, the first struggle involved a period or experiment in techniques and  revolutions in form which culminated in atruotural worlca of precise design and balanced tensions.  Reoorded in the -writing¥ of Nikolaus Pevsner, Philip C. Johnson, Siegfried Giedion and Bruno Zevi,  it is an international and three-dimenaional aohievement wrought by poet engineers. However, the  aecond struggle in pure arahit~oture aenters about the oonoept of spaoe organi&ation and interre_lati~  Aahipe. Ita arohiteotonic image ia still functional but inoreaaingly fluid, its objeotive a  humaniatio blend of internal and external relations governing the aite and the structure, ita me_dium  a teohnical maatery luoid to the po~nt ot transparency. Thia is the direation whioh bestows  order upon the bewildering and abounding variety of architeoture today.  In thia aet, carefully tailored to educational needs, Dr. Blook displays the workáor arohiteota  whose aotivity has been confined largely to California, Oregon, Ari&ona and adjaoent aeotiona.  Every opportunity to interpret by photography and to emphasize by color has been intelligently  exploited by a technioian of wide experienae in the craft of arohiteoture. In the present in_atanoe,  an extraordinary girt for spatial realization of tho thing aeen permits us to study tor  ourselv~¥ two arts inspired by .a single vision.
